You can move the player by pressing the wsad or the arrow keys.
if the player dose not move close the game and reopen it.
press the space bar near the fox to get the quest.
you accomplish the quest if you kill all the enomys.
When you kill all the enomys the game closes.

each of the enomys makes a diffrint sound when they die. that is 3 sound both mouse have the same.
